# Summary
Mount the raspberry pi zero w on the back of a raspberry pi hq camera module so it will be supported when on a camera tripod.

Minimal mount.

Feel free to copy/modify design here:

This assumes holes are about .5mm smaller than they are in cad when printed. This holds true for my printer and ones I have used in the past. At that size this should allow a 2.5mm rpi screw to self-tap. Feel free to modify the hole_slop variable in the link above if it doesn't hold true for you.
